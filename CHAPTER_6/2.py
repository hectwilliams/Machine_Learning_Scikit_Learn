    Q. 

      Is a node's Gini impurity generally lower or greater than its parents. 
      
      Is it generally lower/greater, or always lower/greater?

    A.

      As one traverses the decision tree, each node works to cluster or bound a group of training instances. 

      Generally, the nodes spawned from the root node have a Gini lower than it's parents.
