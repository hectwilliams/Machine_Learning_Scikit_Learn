  Q
    
    Try a Suppoert Vector Machine regressor with various hyperparameters 

  A. 

    Support vector machine does not perform better than my quick contrived candidate model using random forest regressor
 
  2.

  Q.


    Try replacing GridSearchCV with RandomSearchCV 


  A. 

    Refer to housing_api.py, cross-validation variables above Class TrainDataset

    A.

      Refer to housing.api -> preprocess()

  4.

    Q. 

      Try creating a single pipeline that does the fill data preparation plus the final prediction 

    A.

      Refer to housing.api -> preprocess()
