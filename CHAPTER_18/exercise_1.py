Q.
    
    How would you define Reinforcement Learning? How is it different from regular supervised or unsupervised learning?

A.

    Reinforcement Learning is a learning framework which uses software agents to make observations and take actions which produce favorable short or long term rewards, depending on the problem.

    
    In Supervised and Unsupervised learning there are no agents taking any action. The model is trained on a dataset.
