    Q.

    Can you think of three possible applications of RL that were not mentioned in this chapter?
    For each of them, what is the environment? 
    What is the agent? 
    What are some possible actions? What are the rewards?

    A. 

    1) Satellite
        Environment - space, or computer simulation (i.e. game)
        Agent - GPS, Radiometer, land imager, Altimeter, infrared spectrometer 
        Actions - orientation, scanning, dwell, reset, etc, change power modes, transmit
        Rewards - pixel strength, return signal strength, response from base on earth, signal-noise ratio, temperature of hardware systems 


    2) Refrigerators ( home appliance ) 
        Environment - Inside fridge
        Agent - humidity sensor, temperature sensor, spoilage sensor
        Actions - change temperature, send alert to network linked devices, power-on/off LED 
        Rewards - lower spoilage feedback, stable temperature

    3) Hacking 
        Environment - Network
        Agent - software agent, malware 
        Actions - request access to network, learn network, update file, create file 
        Rewards - found file of interest, gaining access to protected network, communicating with hardened networks
