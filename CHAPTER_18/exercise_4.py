    Q. 

        How do you measure the performance of a Reinforcement Learning agent?

    A.
        sum-of-rewards vs episode curve. Ideal or perfect performing agent would have a learning curve with a large sum-of-rewards that is stable, once training starts (buffers are parse prior to training experiences)
