  Q.

    What do model-based learning algorithms search for? What is the most common strategy they use to succeed? How do they make predictions?

  A.

    Model based learning algotirhms search for trends where it can create a linear or nonlinear model. 

    Most common strategy is to create a model and define a cost function to measure how bad the model performs. 

    Preidctions are made by passing training set features to model, and capture the accuracy of the model on the entire dataset.
