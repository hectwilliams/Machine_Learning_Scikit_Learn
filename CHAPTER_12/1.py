  Q.

    How would you describe Tensorflow in a short sentence? 
    
    What are its main features? 
    
    Can you name other popular Deep Learning libraries?

  A.

    Tensorflow is a library for numerical computation, particularly fine-tuned for large-scale Machine Learning 

    Main features its Keras implementation, Data API, and low-level operations.

    Other popular Deep Learning Libraries: 
     
      - Pytorch, 
      
      - Keras
