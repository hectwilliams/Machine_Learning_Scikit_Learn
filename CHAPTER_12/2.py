  Q. 

    Is TensorFlow a drop-in replacement for NumPy? 
    
    What are the main differences betweem the two?

  A.

    Tensorflow operations handle and process tensors. Tensors are similar to Numpy, not a safe drop-in. 
    
    Numpy is an ndarray, while a tensor can hold a scalar value or multidimensional array
