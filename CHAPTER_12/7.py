  Q.

    When should you create a custom layer versus a custom model?

  A.

    Custom layer required for repetitive layers, or a layer with unique structures. Both cases these would be called sub-blocks. 

    Custom models required when integrating custom layers or complex networks not producable by functional and sequential models
