      Q.

        Why would you want to use

        a. Ridge Regression instead of plain Linear Regression

        b. Lasso instread of Ridge Regression 

        c. Elastic Net instread of Lasso 

      A. 

        a.

          - to reduce model parameters (weights)

          - reduce model variance 

        b. 

          - removes least important features 

        c.
          
          -  if number of features is large 

          - if features are strongly correlated. 

          - lasso is erratic when features are larger than number of instances
