      Q. 

        Is it a good idea to stop Mini-batch Gradient Descent immediately when the validation error goes up? 

      A. 

        I would be concerned as mini-batch learning steps should converage well compared to stochastic algorithm. 

        It would be best to stop training evaluate pipeline if the error persists for large number of epochs.
