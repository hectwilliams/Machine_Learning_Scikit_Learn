      Q.

        Which Gradient Descent Algorithm will reach the vicinity of the optimal solution the fatest? Which will actually converage. How can you make the others converage as well?

      A. 

        Mini-Batch Gradient Descent is the fastest.

        Batch Gradient Descent is likely to converage (provided a good training dataset).

        A good learning schedule will help the alogirthm converage better.
