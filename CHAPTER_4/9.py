      Q.

        Suppose you are using Ridge Regression and you notice that the training error
        and the validation error are almost equal and fairly high. 
        Would you say that the model suffers from high bias or high variance?
        Should you increase the regularization hyperparameters (alpha-param) or reduce?

      A.
      
        Model is overfitting, sufferring from high variance polynomial fit

        Lowering the regularization rate is will lower high variance
