    Q.
        If can autoencoder perfectly reconstructs the inputs, is it necessarily a good autoencoder? How can you evaluate the performance of an autoencoder.

    A.

        An autoencoder perfectly constructing inputs will not generalize well on other data instances, it is not a good autoencoder as it has learned insights on a single data instance. 

        Autoencoders are measured by reducing the dimensionality for visualization and finding similarity between the clusters created by the autoencoder and training data classes.
