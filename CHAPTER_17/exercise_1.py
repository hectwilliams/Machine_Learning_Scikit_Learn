Q.
    What are the main tasks that autoencoders are used for?

A.

    Learns or discover about itself while constraining the dataset(e.g. filtering the data, reducing dimensionality, etc). The result is a 'constrained representative' of the original dataset. 

    Think of a substitute teacher replacing the best teacher in the world. The substitute teacher may not have the same skills as the best teacher but the substitute will try to emulate the teacher and produce the same outcome as the best teacher.
