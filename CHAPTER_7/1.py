  Q. if you have trained five different models on the exact same training data, and they all achieve 95% precision 

      is there any chance that you can combine these models to get better results? 

      if so how, if not why?


  A.

    Yes, aggregating the five models to a majority vote classifier will improve the results. 

    Even though the three seperate models are performing well, aggregating the models will achieve performance either close or little better than the best classifier
