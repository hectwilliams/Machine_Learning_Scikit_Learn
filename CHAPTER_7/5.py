  Q.

      What makes Extra-Trees more random than regular Random Forests? 

      How can this extra randomness help?

      Are Extra-Trees slower or faster than regular Random Forests?

    A.

      Extra-Trees use random threshold for each features rather than searching for the best possible threshold like Random Forests.

      Extra randomness speeds up computation and lowers variances.
