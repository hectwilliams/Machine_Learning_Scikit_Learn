    Q.
        What are model parrallelism and data parallelism? Why is the latter generally recommended.
    
    A. 
        Model parrallelism is split across devices

        Data parrallelism is replicated across every device 

        Data Parrallelism's simplicity is preferred as model parrallistem requires special care and tuning.
