  Q. 

    How can you evaluate the performance of a dimensionality reduction algorithm on your dataset?

  A. 

    1) Find an optimal dimensional reduction ( plotting the explained various vs dimensions should help ) 

    2) Select kernel and hyperparameter for that yields a low reconstruction error
