  Q.

    In what case would you use vanilla PCA, Incremental PCA, Randomized PCA, or Kernel PCA

    Vanilla PCA

      -use for low dimensional datasets 

    Incremental PCA
      
      - Memory constraints 

      - large training sets 

      - process information on the fly in real-time when new instances arrive 

    Randomized PCA
      
      - increase speed as it uses an approximation of full SVD 

      - d is significantly less than n (number of features)

    Kernel PCA
      
      - high dimensional dataset

      - nonlinear projections  for dimension reduction
