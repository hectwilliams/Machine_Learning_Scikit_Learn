  Q. 

    Does it make sense to chain two different dimensionality reduction algorithms?

  A.

    Yes, some algorithms may be good at clustering while another may be good at finding classes which are farthest apart. Combination of those would produce an algorithm with good seperation between d-reduced set.

    Some algorithms are better are filtering outlier or useless data. 

    Combining algorithms may speed up processing time (filter outlier d-reduce algorithm followed by a clusting perfomant d-reduce algorithm  )
