   Q. 

      Can you name two clustering algorithms that can scale to large datasets? And two that look for regions of high density?

    A.

      Algorithms which scale well on large datasets:

        - BIRCH 

        - K-Means 

        - Aggolmerative clustering scales nice if connectivey matrix is provided 

      Algorithms that look for regions of high density:

        - Mean Shift 

        - Affinity Propagation 

        - DBScan
