  Can you think of a use case where active learning would be useful?

  Q. 

    Active learning would be useful for flagging unripe oranges using sensor application :

    
      1) OrangeClassifier program inspects oranges that pass thru chamber and classifies whether they are ripe or unripe.

      2) Developer is uncertain about predictions made on a large batch of oranges; they are passed to employee to label in the system.

      3) Process is repeated until developer is confident about program
