Q.

  Why is it generally preferable to use a Logistic Regression classifier rather than a classical Perceptron.

  How can you tweak a Perception to make it equivalent to a Logistic Regression classifier 

A. 

  Logistic Regression classifier makes 'soft' predictions , while Perception makes 'hard' predictions.

  A tweak to make an equivalent logistic regression classifier, feed the first layer perception to an artificial neuron with a logistic activation function.
