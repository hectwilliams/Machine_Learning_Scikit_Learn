  Q.

    How many neurons do you need in the output layer if you want to classify email into spam or email?
    What activation function should you use in the output layer?
    If instead you want to tackle MNIST, how many neurons do you need in the output layer, and which activation function should you use?
    What about for getting your network to predict housing prices, as in Chapter 2.

  A. 

    Single output neuron is required to classify email as spam or ham 

    Use sigmoid function at the output layer 

    MNIST requires 10 output neurons and softmax activiation is used for the output layer 

    Predicting housing income is a regression task with a single output neuron and no activation function
