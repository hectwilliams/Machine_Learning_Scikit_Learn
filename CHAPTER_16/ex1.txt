What are the pros and cons of using a stateful RNN versus a stateless RNN?

CONS:

- Increased learning time 

- Larger model ( state persistent and returned after each batch iteration )

- Batch data must be have a contigious data flow for each batch set of words 

- requires complex preprocessing , due to batch architecture 


PROS:

- Model can learn long-term patterns while learning on short sequences 

- Predictions require the same batch data size used during training
